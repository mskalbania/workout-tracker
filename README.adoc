Workout tracker gRPC implementation based on https://roadmap.sh/projects/fitness-workout-tracker

* DB init script & seeder (as per exercise requirement): [db.sql](db.sql)
* Docker compose to spin up services and dependencies: [docker-compose.yaml](docker-compose.yaml)
* Using protoc to generate gRPC code: [proto](proto)


More TODO/Ideas:

* server streaming for get endpoints
* Add refresh tokens - currently re-login is required after access token expiry.
* Switch to always online validation of JWT tokens and keep offline as fallback to invalidate JWT tokens on logout, currently logout = remove token from device cache. Since project is gRPC latency tradeoff could be acceptable.
