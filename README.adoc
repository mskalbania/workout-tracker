Workout tracker gRPC implementation based on https://roadmap.sh/projects/fitness-workout-tracker


More TODO/Ideas:

* Hash passwords
* Use postgres for user storage
* Add refresh tokens - currently re-login is required after access token expiry.
* Switch to always online validation of JWT tokens and keep offline as fallback to invalidate JWT tokens on logout, currently logout = remove token from device cache. Since project is gRPC latency tradeoff could be acceptable.
