= Authorization Server

Naive gRPC implementation of Authorization Server to fulfill authentication requirements for workout-tracker.

- Server uses in-memory storage for users.
- Issues JWT token when username and password are valid.
- JWT contains user id and expiration time which is enough to fulfill access control requirements for workout-tracker.
- JWT is signed with symmetric key, the least secure option, but enough for this example.
