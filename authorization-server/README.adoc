= Authorization Server

gRPC implementation of Authorization Server to fulfill authentication requirements for workout-tracker.

- Server uses postgres db to store user data.
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt.
- Issues JWT token when username and password are valid.
- JWT contains user id and expiration time which is enough to fulfill access control requirements for workout-tracker.
- JWT is signed with symmetric key, one of the least secure option, but enough for this example.
